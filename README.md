# ChroniclesOfEternia
Using Python I created a game calle "Chronicles of Eternia."

# Story Line
The main protagonist(elf) receives a fragment of an ancient artifact known as the "Eternia Crystal" from his dying father. 
This ancient artifact is believed to be the key to a powerful weapon. However, the Fallen(Corrupted elves) are also after 
the ancient artifact. Travel across the different realms and dungeons to gather the scattered fragments to unlock the prize.
